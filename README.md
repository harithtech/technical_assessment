Intern Candidate Technical Assessment

Your application must have the following:
1. Display a contacts list that is sorted based on the time. The time should be displayed in
the format of “time ago” eg. 1 minute ago or 1 hour ago. The ordering of the list should
be started from the most recent to the oldest.
2. Given an example that you have 30 sets of data and you are only displaying half of it.
Users are able to load the remaining data by pulling up the list.
3. Users must be able to pull-to-refresh to generate a set of 5 random contacts data and
append to the existing list.
4. If the user has scrolled down the list and reached the end. An indicator should inform the
user that “You have reached end of the list”
5. Users are able to change between the original time format and format “time ago” with a
toggle button and keep the changes even if users kill the app.
